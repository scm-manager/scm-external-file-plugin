![Create new external file](assets/createModal.png)

To create an external file, we recommend to use the related modal. All external files will be created as `.URL` files which must contain the target url of the actual file.


![Open external file](assets/openFile.png)

These `.URL` files will be rendered as anchor links to open the target file in a new tab.

![Edit external file](assets/modifyButton.png)

To edit an external file, use the edit button from the file's overflow menu.

![Edit external file](assets/modifyModal.png)

The edit dialog looks similar to the creation one, but you can only change the url and provide a commit message.
You can still move the link as you would move any other file.
